Watermark Generator

Watermark Generator  is a Windows app that adds a text watermark to images.

The user can select multiple images with the Browse button, and type their text
in the text box. When they click the Generate button, a copy of each image will
be created in an "ExportedImages" directory, out of the directory that the app
is in.
